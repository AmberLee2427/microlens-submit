## Beta-Test Edits
- [x] `remove_event()` function (and CLI)
- [x] `remove_solution()` function (and CLI)
- [x] Window 11 text editior
- [x] Quickstart/tutorial:
  - [x] cd to project directory
    or
  - [x] init without name inside the existing project folder
    and
  - [x] must include repo
    and
  - [x] must include hardware info
    or
  - [x] nexus init
- [x] required venv with windows (huh? who uses windows anyway?)
    - [x] export location-of-script to PATH
    Some of my beta testers where having issues with the PyPI release on widows. Fuck windows, but I guesss we should try to fix it. The issue they were having was that "the scripts weren't being added to their path unless the used a venv". Is this a them problem, like they are just setting up their python wrong, or is this an us problem?
- [x] add GPU section to hardware info
- [x] auto populate hardware info
- [x] ".001" gets interpreted as a string
- [x] nexus init gives hardware warning and it doesn't need to
- [x] nexus dosiers (with submission in /teams/*) not displaying images (problem in AAS workshop notebooks)
- [x] "Experienced' tier not "Advanced"
- [x] validate physical parameters
- [x] "piEN (instead of piEN)" when piEN was missing
- [x] additional model types
- [x] git and submission in different locations (add git_dir)
- [x] Windows build in workflow
- [x] Release Workflow
- [x] Wheel build CI
- [x] Unhelpful error when band not supoplied but a flux value is
- [x] What the fuck do we do about uncertainties?
  - meta data and the same single value or paired values options


## Conda Forge
- [x] Windows installer isn't made?
- [x] Workflow to update version in recipe and sync feedstock
- [ ] related to do's from other projects:
  - [ ] MulensModel feedstock
  - [ ] VBMicrolensing feedstock

## v1.0.0 debug
- [x] undo image bug fuck up
- [x] fix image asset bug in dossiers
- [x] add `data_challenge_0_129_335` to `test` tier allowed event list
- [x] "Invalid parameter 'F0_S' for model type '1S1L'; Invalid parameter 'F0_B' for model type '1S1L'"
- [x] need a more graceful resolution to alias duplicates
